I have strong eagerness to explore new domains and my ability to grasp complex concepts has allowed me to become a well-rounded and versatile computer science enthusiast.

My primary responsibilities within the group is to build echohshader project. [Echoshader](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echoshader), an open source project, aims to enhance the ability to interactively visualize large amounts of cloud-based data to accelerate the data exploration and discovery process. Echoshader will be developed in parallel with the ongoing development of [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#), which handles the standardization, preprocessing and organization of echo data.
