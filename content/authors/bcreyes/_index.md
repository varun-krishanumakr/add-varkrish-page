I truly believe that mathematics is a universal language that can solve some of the world’s most difficult problems! I also recognize that to accomplish these tasks, it is absolutely necessary to employ mathematical techniques in conjunction with software development and distributed computing. I am lucky enough to use these skills to support the UW Echospace’s group goal of extracting knowledge from large volumes of ocean acoustic data.

My primary responsibilities within the group include: 
   * The development of [echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype)
   * Optimizing computational operations for distributed computing
   * Building a scalable cloud cyberinfrastructure
