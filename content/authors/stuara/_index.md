I am an undergrad at the University of Washington studying Marine Biology and Art. I intend to graduate in the Spring of 2023. I hope to pursue projects where both scientific and artistic thinking can complement each other.

With Echospace, I am assisting with the creation of programs used to analyze and compress large volumes of biologically-oriented acoustic data, including that of the [NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center) Pacific hake survey. I will be further developing my programming skills to better benefit this and future projects.

I am also participating in the collection and analysis of passive acoustic data targeting native bat species from the UW Union Bay Natural Area, as well as the operation and deployment of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and ADCP-equipped glider off the Washington Coastal Shelf.
