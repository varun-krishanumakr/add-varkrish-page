I am an environmental informatics expert with a science background in aquatic biogeochemistry, hydrology and oceanography, focused on the development and implementation of systems for the management and open dissemination of environmental data in marine and terrestrial applications. I have more than 20 years of experience designing, managing and automating data systems and workflows for environmental applications. My work emphasizes collaborative approaches and tools that engage diverse partners, and its scope ranges from local (Pacific NW) to national and global applications.
