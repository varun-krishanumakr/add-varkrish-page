## Research Assistant 

I am an oceanographer and data scientist currently using Python to perform analysis on multi-year time-series data of seawater characteristics and sonar. I will also be helping conduct data and metadata organization and analysis of sonar observations from the NWFSC Pacific hake survey and use the echopype Python package to convert, quality assure, process, and visualize sonar data for distributed computing. In my free time, I enjoy writing for my blog about ocean data science, including write-ups of my projects and Python tutorials. 

I have experience in Python programming, data science, data analysis, data visualization, statistical modeling, machine learning, research, and science writing. I love learning and teaching others how to use Python to answer questions about the world with data. 

I earned my bachelor's degree in oceanography from the University of Washington in 2020. During my time as a student, I enjoyed working part-time in ocean data analysis and visualization. After graduating, I pursued data science more seriously by completing an immersive data science certificate program through General Assembly. I'm excited to be applying my programming skills to real-world ocean data and contributing to research in both the oceanography and data science communities.
