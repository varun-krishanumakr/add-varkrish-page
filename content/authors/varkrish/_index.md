I am a student studying both Computer Science and Environmental Science at the University of Washington. I am expected to graduate in the summer of 2026.

I have experience with a number of programming languages, including basic data analysis in R, some programming in Python, and extensive exposure making and manipulating data structures in Java, C, and C++.

As a recent addition to the Echospace team, I have small roles in a few different projects. I currently make weekly trips to Union Bay Natural Area to deploy and retrieve AudioMoth recorders. Additionally, I manually verify spectrogram bat calls marked by Machine Learning Algorithms as part of the Bat Detector Validation project. In the future, I hope to use echolocation data to determine behavioral patterns in bats in response to various environmental variables such as artificial lighting.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you have any questions!
