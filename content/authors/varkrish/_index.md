I am a second year student at the University of Washington studying both Environmental Science and Computer Science with an emphasis on Data Science. I am expected to graduate in the summer of 2026.

I have experience using R for data analysis and have some experience doing so in Python as well. I also have experience creating and working with data structures in Java, C, and C++.

As a recent addition to the Echospace team, I have a few small roles in a few different projects. I am involved with deploying and recovering AudioMoth recorders in the Union Bay Natural Area as part Union Bay Field Project. Additionally, I am assisting with the Bat Detector Validation project by manually analyzing and marking bat calls on spectrograms. In the future, I hope to be able to analyze bat acoustic data to determine behavioralistic patterns in response to various environmental factors, such as artificial lighting. 

Please feel free to email me any questions you have!
