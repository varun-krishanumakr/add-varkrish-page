<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Huang lab at NYU Biology (<a href="https://huanglab.rbind.io/" class="uri">https://huanglab.rbind.io/</a>) is looking for a highly motivated and independent individual to work as a Postdoctoral Associate. This position is for a post-PhD trainee preparing for a career path in research. The planned position will provide a transition to career independence through the development of professional skills; supervision by faculty mentor incorporating individual development plan in support of training goals and those of the faculty mentor; and publication of research findings/scholarship during postdoc appointment period. We aim to build a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative lab, and are committed to provide a supportive environment for lab members to achieve scientific excellence and gain expertise in both computational and experimental skills.</p>
<p>Projects in the Huang lab use both “dry”- and “wet”-lab genomics methods to study gene regulation at the systems level. Specifically, we are interested in understanding how the within-species genome and epigenome variation gives rise to variation in the regulatory networks that underlie phenotypic variation. We work with the reference plant Arabidopsis and collaborate with multiple groups working on agriculturally and ecologically important plants. The planned project is recently funded by the NSF for theoretical and experimental development of the DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAPseq) technique for mapping and characterization of cis-regulatory variation in plant genomes.</p>

<div id="qualifications" class="section level3">
<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<p>The ideal candidate will hold a PhD with expertise in any of the areas below, as evidenced by first-author or co- first-author publications: plant biology, molecular biology, genetics/genomics, ecology/evolution, or computational biology. Relevant skills and experience include molecular cloning, protein expression and purification, next generation sequencing technologies, single cell genomics, comparative genomics, analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, basic statistics, computer programming and/or machine learning. Experience with Arabidopsis and/or plant genome editing is a plus. The position is expected to continue for multiple years contingent on satisfactory performance.</p>
