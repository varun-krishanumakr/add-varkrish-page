**`Echopype`** is an open-source Python package aimed at
[enhancing the interoperability and scalability](https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why.html)
in processing ocean sonar data for biological information.

I started building this package in early 2018 when I couldn't find an affordable tool that
allow easy access and manipulation of echosounder data collected by
different sonar models.

Check out my talk at SciPy 2019 that discussed the goals and philosophy of echopype:
